## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Dont forget to include your information for citation so you get credit for your work! I would love help making this deploy to heroku correctly. The application mostly works (except comments) because I became frustrated and I'm running out of time. Submitting my code as is so I can recieve a complete grade, even if it isn't great.
